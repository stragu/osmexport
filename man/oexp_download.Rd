Northern latitude (in this order)}

\item{destfile}{path to download the file to. Defaults to "map.osm" in the

\description{
Download an OSM export by specifying its bounding box, which only mimics the
\url{https://www.openstreetmap.org} "Export" functionality. The
osmexport package does not further make use of the OSM API, given
that it is mainly intended to be used for editing purposes, as explained on
the API Usage Policy website:
